His research focuses on the impacts of agricultural production methods on the environment and natural resources. David is particularly interested in the economics of precision agriculture technologies and the response of cropping patterns and land use change to emerging biofuels policy at the Federal level. His doctoral dissertation research investigated the relative profitability of several different mid-season optimal nitrogen rate prediction systems for winter wheat in Oklahoma, and investigated how incorporation of uncertainty in estimated and predicted production functions can increase the profitability of the prediction systems. David’s MS thesis investigated the suitability of water quality trading as a policy instrument for dealing with nutrient runoff from agricultural operations in Tennessee. Results showed conditions in polluted watersheds in Tennessee likely will not support robust trading in water quality allowances or offsets.\n",
